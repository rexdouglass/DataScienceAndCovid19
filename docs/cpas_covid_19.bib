  abstract = {We recommend the immediate universal adoption of cloth facemasks, including homemade, and accompanying policies to increase the supply of medical masks for health workers. Universal adoption will likely slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus by reducing transmission from asymptomatic individuals. We provide strongly suggestive evidence from cross-country data that facemask use slows the growth rate of cases and deaths. This complements extant scientific data on mask usage. Our analysis suggests each cloth facemask generates thousands of dollars in value from reduced mortality risk. Each medical mask, when used by a healthcare worker,  may generate millions of dollars in value, and policies to encourage greater production prioritized for health workers are urgently needed.},

  abstract = {Limited vaccine availability and the potential for resistance to antiviral medications have led to calls for establishing the efficacy of non-pharmaceutical measures for mitigating pandemic influenza. Our objective was to examine if the use of face masks and hand hygiene reduced rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) and laboratory-confirmed influenza in the natural setting. A cluster-randomized intervention trial was designed involving 1,178 young adults living in 37 residence houses in 5 university residence halls during the 2007\textendash 2008 influenza season. Participants were assigned to face mask and hand hygiene, face mask only, or control group during the study. Discrete-time survival models using generalized estimating equations to estimate intervention effects on ILI and confirmed influenza A/B infection over a 6-week study period were examined. A significant reduction in the rate of ILI was observed in weeks 3 through 6 of the study, with a maximum reduction of 75\% during the final study week (rate ratio [RR] = 0.25, [95\% CI, 0.07 to 0.87]). Both intervention groups compared to the control showed cumulative reductions in rates of influenza over the study period, although results did not reach statistical significance. Generalizability limited to similar settings and age groups. Face masks and hand hygiene combined may reduce the rate of ILI and confirmed influenza in community settings. These non-pharmaceutical measures should be recommended in crowded settings at the start of an influenza pandemic. Trail Registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00490633},

Purpose To compare medical masks to N95 respirators in preventing laboratory-confirmed viral infection and respiratory illness including coronavirus specifically in healthcare workers. Data Sources MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL from January 1, 2014, to March 9, 2020. Update of published search conducted from January 1, 1990, to December 9, 2014. Study Selection Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the protective effect of medical masks to N95 respirators in healthcare workers. Data Extraction Reviewer pair independently screened, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence. Data Synthesis Four RCTs were meta-analyzed adjusting for clustering. Compared with N95 respirators; the use of medical masks did not increase laboratory-confirmed viral (including coronaviruses) respiratory infection (OR 1.06; 95\% CI 0.90-1.25; I2 = 0\%; low certainty in the evidence) or clinical respiratory illness (OR 1.49; 95\% CI: 0.98-2.28; I2 = 78\%; very low certainty in the evidence). Only one trial evaluated coronaviruses separately and found no difference between the two groups (P = .49). Limitations Indirectness and imprecision of available evidence. Conclusions Low certainty evidence suggests that medical masks and N95 respirators offer similar protection against viral respiratory infection including coronavirus in healthcare workers during non\textendash aerosol-generating care. Preservation of N95 respirators for high-risk, aerosol-generating procedures in this pandemic should be considered when in short supply.},

  abstract = {Knowing the infection fatality rate (IFR) of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infections is essential for the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data through April 20, 2020, we fit a statistical model to COVID-19 case fatality rates over time at the US county level to estimate the COVID-19 IFR among symptomatic cases (IFR-S) as time goes to infinity. The IFR-S in the US was estimated to be 1.3\% (95\% central credible interval: 0.6\% to 2.1\%). County-specific rates varied from 0.5\% to 3.6\%. The overall IFR for COVID-19 should be lower when we account for cases that remain and recover without symptoms. When used with other estimating approaches, our model and our estimates can help disease and policy modelers to obtain more accurate predictions for the epidemiology of the disease and the impact of alternative policy levers to contain this pandemic. The model could also be used with future epidemics to get an early sense of the magnitude of symptomatic infection at the population-level before more direct estimates are available. Substantial variation across patient demographics likely exists and should be the focus of future studies.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background Addressing COVID-19 is a pressing health and social concern. To date, many epidemic projections and policies addressing COVID-19 have been designed without seroprevalence data to inform epidemic parameters. We measured the seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a community sample drawn from Santa Clara County. Methods On April 3-4, 2020, we tested county residents for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using a lateral flow immunoassay. Participants were recruited using Facebook ads targeting a sample of individuals living within the county by demographic and geographic characteristics. We estimate weights to adjust our sample to match the zip code, sex, and race/ethnicity distribution within the county. We report both the weighted and unweighted prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. We also adjust for test performance characteristics by combining data from 16 independent samples obtained from manufacturer9s data, regulatory submissions, and independent evaluations: 13 samples for specificity (3,324 specimens) and 3 samples for sensitivity (157 specimens). Results The raw prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in our sample was 1.5\% (exact binomial 95CI 1.1-2.0\%). Test performance specificity in our data was 99.5\% (95CI 99.2-99.7\%) and sensitivity was 82.8\% (95CI 76.0-88.4\%). The unweighted prevalence adjusted for test performance characteristics was 1.2\% (95CI 0.7-1.8\%). After weighting for population demographics of Santa Clara County, the prevalence was 2.8\% (95CI 1.3-4.7\%), using bootstrap to estimate confidence bounds. These prevalence point estimates imply that 54,000 (95CI 25,000 to 91,000 using weighted prevalence; 23,000 with 95CI 14,000-35,000 using unweighted prevalence) people were infected in Santa Clara County by early April, many more than the approximately 1,000 confirmed cases at the time of the survey. Conclusions The estimated population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Santa Clara County implies that the infection may be much more widespread than indicated by the number of confirmed cases. More studies are needed to improve precision of prevalence estimates. Locally-derived population prevalence estimates should be used to calibrate epidemic and mortality projections.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background
The Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) Monitoring and Accountability Framework includes an indicator to reach 90\% national vaccination coverage and 80\% vaccination coverage in every district or equivalent administrative unit with three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis containing vaccines (DTP) across all 194 country signatories to GVAP by 2020. Assessment of progress against the district indicator component requires GVAP defined ``valid'' coverage. GVAP defines district coverage ``valid'' if the WHO and UNICEF estimate of national immunization coverage for DTP3 in the most recent year is 1) {$\geq$}90\%, or 2) is identical to the reported national administrative coverage for DTP3 (regardless of coverage level). We draw attention to the potential disconnect that currently exists between GVAP vaccination coverage indicators and the practical capacity to monitor progress against those indicators.

Methods
We obtained national and aggregated district coverage data for the third dose of DTP containing vaccine (DTP3) for 194 countries for 2016 from publicly available databases maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO). We reviewed district line lists of coverage data for 96 countries for which district line lists of DTP3 coverage were available and categorized the district coverage values using the same groupings used by the GVAP Monitoring Framework. In doing so, we also tracked the number of districts with reported coverage {$>$}100\%.

Results
In 2016, at least one district with DTP3 coverage value {$>$}100\% was reported in the line lists of 76 of the 96 countries. Agreement in district coverage categories across each of five coverage groupings ({$<$}50\%, 50-79\%, 80-89\%, 90-94\%, {$\geq$}95\%) was observed in 43 of the 96 countries. In 2016, 46 of 194 countries were classified as achieving both national DTP3 coverage {$\geq$}90\% and DTP3 coverage {$\geq$}80\% in every district, thereby achieving the GVAP target. Among these 46 countries, 22 countries reported district line-listing coverage data. We identified 10 of the 22 countries that reported at least one district with DTP3 coverage {$>$}100\% ranging from 8\% of districts in Sri Lanka to 97\% of districts in Bangladesh. Seven countries reported at least 25\% of the total districts had DTP3 coverage {$>$}100\%.

Conclusions
The observations of disparate district coverage from a subset of countries reporting district line lists of coverage data are a concern for the current GVAP approach ascribing the achievement of ``valid'' district coverage data. Our review of district line lists of coverage data does not support a current GVAP assumption that the district coverage values {$\geq$}80\% fall between 80\% and 100\% (inclusive). We hope these results spur a review of the current approach to assess the GVAP coverage target of {$\geq$}90\% national DTP3 coverage and {$\geq$}80\% DTP3 coverage in all districts.},

To estimate the male and female populations by age in 2010, the proportions of males and females in each 5-year age group from ages 0-4 to ages 85+ for the given census year were calculated. These proportions were then applied to the 2010 estimates of the total population to obtain 2010 estimates of male and female populations by age. In some cases, the spatial resolution of the age and sex proportions was coarser than the resolution of the total population estimates to which they were applied. The population density rasters were created by dividing the population count rasters by the land area raster. The data files were produced as global rasters at 30 arc-second (\textasciitilde 1 km at the equator) resolution. To enable faster global processing, and in support of research communities, the 30 arc-second data were aggregated to 2.5 arc-minute, 15 arc-minute, 30 arc-minute and 1 degree resolutions.},

We aimed to investigate the effects of physical distance, face masks, and eye protection on virus transmission in health-care and non-health-care (eg, community) settings.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Methods{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimum distance for avoiding person-to-person virus transmission and to assess the use of face masks and eye protection to prevent transmission of viruses. We obtained data for SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronaviruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome, and Middle East respiratory syndrome from 21 standard WHO-specific and COVID-19-specific sources. We searched these data sources from database inception to May 3, 2020, with no restriction by language, for comparative studies and for contextual factors of acceptability, feasibility, resource use, and equity. We screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias in duplicate. We did frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses and random-effects meta-regressions. We rated the certainty of evidence according to Cochrane methods and the GRADE approach.

Transmission of viruses was lower with physical distancing of 1 m or more, compared with a distance of less than 1 m (n=10 736, pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0{$\cdot$}18, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}09 to 0{$\cdot$}38; risk difference [RD] -10{$\cdot$}2\%, 95\% CI -11{$\cdot$}5 to -7{$\cdot$}5; moderate certainty); protection was increased as distance was lengthened (change in relative risk [RR] 2{$\cdot$}02 per m; \emph{p}\textsubscript{interaction}=0{$\cdot$}041; moderate certainty). Face mask use could result in a large reduction in risk of infection (n=2647; aOR 0{$\cdot$}15, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}07 to 0{$\cdot$}34, RD -14{$\cdot$}3\%, -15{$\cdot$}9 to -10{$\cdot$}7; low certainty), with stronger associations with N95 or similar respirators compared with disposable surgical masks or similar (eg, reusable 12\textendash 16-layer cotton masks; \emph{p}\textsubscript{interaction}=0{$\cdot$}090; posterior probability {$>$}95\%, low certainty). Eye protection also was associated with less infection (n=3713; aOR 0{$\cdot$}22, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}12 to 0{$\cdot$}39, RD -10{$\cdot$}6\%, 95\% CI -12{$\cdot$}5 to -7{$\cdot$}7; low certainty). Unadjusted studies and subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed similar findings.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Interpretation{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis support physical distancing of 1 m or more and provide quantitative estimates for models and contact tracing to inform policy. Optimum use of face masks, respirators, and eye protection in public and health-care settings should be informed by these findings and contextual factors.

However, many public health officials have warned that mass protests could lead to a reduction in social distancing behavior, spurring a resurgence of COVID-19. This study uses newly collected data on protests in 315 of the largest U.S. cities to estimate the impacts of mass protests on social distancing and COVID-19 case growth. Event-study analyses provide strong evidence that net stay-at-home behavior increased following protest onset, consistent with the hypothesis that non-protesters' behavior was substantially affected by urban protests. This effect was not fully explained by the imposition of city curfews. Estimated effects were generally larger for persistent protests and those accompanied by media reports of violence. Furthermore, we find no evidence that urban protests reignited COVID-19 case growth during the more than three weeks following protest onset. We conclude that predictions of broad negative public health consequences of Black Lives Matter protests were far too narrowly conceived.},

A major challenge for short-term forecasts is the assessment of key epidemiological parameters and how they change when first interventions show an effect. By combining an established epidemiological model with Bayesian inference, we analyze the time dependence of the effective growth rate of new infections. Focusing on COVID-19 spread in Germany, we detect change points in the effective growth rate that correlate well with the times of publicly announced interventions. Thereby, we can quantify the effect of interventions, and we can incorporate the corresponding change points into forecasts of future scenarios and case numbers.

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Drug-resistant tuberculosis transmission in hospitals threatens staff and patient health. Surgical face masks used by patients with tuberculosis (TB) are believed to reduce transmission but have not been rigorously tested.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to quantify the efficacy of surgical face masks when worn by patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB).
METHODS: Over 3 months, 17 patients with pulmonary MDR-TB occupied an MDR-TB ward in South Africa and wore face masks on alternate days. Ward air was exhausted to two identical chambers, each housing 90 pathogen-free guinea pigs that breathed ward air either when patients wore surgical face masks (intervention group) or when patients did not wear masks (control group). Efficacy was based on differences in guinea pig infections in each chamber.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-nine of 90 control guinea pigs (76.6\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 68-85\%) became infected, compared with 36 of 90 intervention guinea pigs (40\%; 95\% CI, 31-51\%), representing a 56\% (95\% CI, 33-70.5\%) decreased risk of TB transmission when patients used masks.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical face masks on patients with MDR-TB significantly reduced transmission and offer an adjunct measure for reducing TB transmission from infectious patients.},

We develop a compartmental model for assessing the community-wide impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public, a portion of which may be asymptomatically infectious. Model simulations, using data relevant to COVID-19 dynamics in the US states of New York and Washington, suggest that broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths. Moreover, mask use decreases the effective transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask effectiveness (as a fraction of potentially infectious contacts blocked) and coverage rate (as a fraction of the general population), while the impact on epidemiologic outcomes (death, hospitalizations) is highly nonlinear, indicating masks could synergize with other non-pharmaceutical measures. Notably, masks are found to be useful with respect to both preventing illness in healthy persons and preventing asymptomatic transmission. Hypothetical mask adoption scenarios, for Washington and New York state, suggest that immediate near universal (80\%) adoption of moderately (50\%) effective masks could prevent on the order of 17\textendash 45\% of projected deaths over two months in New York, while decreasing the peak daily death rate by 34\textendash 58\%, absent other changes in epidemic dynamics. Even very weak masks (20\% effective) can still be useful if the underlying transmission rate is relatively low or decreasing: In Washington, where baseline transmission is much less intense, 80\% adoption of such masks could reduce mortality by 24\textendash 65\% (and peak deaths 15\textendash 69\%), compared to 2\textendash 9\% mortality reduction in New York (peak death reduction 9\textendash 18\%). Our results suggest use of face masks by the general public is potentially of high value in curtailing community transmission and the burden of the pandemic. The community-wide benefits are likely to be greatest when face masks are used in conjunction with other non-pharmaceutical practices (such as social-distancing), and when adoption is nearly universal (nation-wide) and compliance is high.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Since its emergence and detection in Wuhan, China in late 2019, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread to nearly every country around the world, resulting in hundreds of thousands of infections to date. The virus was first detected in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States in January, 2020, with subsequent COVID-19 outbreaks detected in all 50 states by early March. To uncover the sources of SARS-CoV-2 introductions and patterns of spread within the U.S., we sequenced nine viral genomes from early reported COVID-19 patients in Connecticut. Our phylogenetic analysis places the majority of these genomes with viruses sequenced from Washington state. By coupling our genomic data with domestic and international travel patterns, we show that early SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Connecticut was likely driven by domestic introductions. Moreover, the risk of domestic importation to Connecticut exceeded that of international importation by mid-March regardless of our estimated impacts of federal travel restrictions. This study provides evidence for widespread, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the U.S. and highlights the critical need for local surveillance.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/location/isolate/date. While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined, the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This will improve our understanding of virus\textendash host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks.},

Here, we highlight the challenge of interpreting observational evidence from non-random samples of the population, which may be affected by collider bias. We illustrate these issues using data from the UK Biobank in which individuals tested for COVID-19 are highly selected for a wide range of genetic, behavioural, cardiovascular, demographic, and anthropometric traits. We discuss the sampling mechanisms that leave aetiological studies of COVID-19 infection and progression particularly susceptible to collider bias. We also describe several tools and strategies that could help mitigate the effects of collider bias in extant studies of COVID-19 and make available a web app for performing sensitivity analyses. While bias due to non-random sampling should be explored in existing studies, the optimal way to mitigate the problem is to use appropriate sampling strategies at the study design stage.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource under Application Number 16729.

Policymakers need guidance on how masks should be used by the general population to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we synthesize the relevant literature to inform multiple areas: 1) transmission characteristics of COVID-19, 2) filtering characteristics and efficacy of masks, 3) estimated population impacts of widespread community mask use, and 4) sociological considerations for policies concerning mask-wearing. A primary route of transmission of COVID-19 is likely via small respiratory droplets, and is known to be transmissible from presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Reducing disease spread requires two things: first, limit contacts of infected individuals via physical distancing and contact tracing with appropriate quarantine, and second, reduce the transmission probability per contact by wearing masks in public, among other measures. The preponderance of evidence indicates that mask wearing reduces the transmissibility per contact by reducing transmission of infected droplets in both laboratory and clinical contexts. Public mask wearing is most effective at stopping spread of the virus when compliance is high. The decreased transmissibility could substantially reduce the death toll and economic impact while the cost of the intervention is low. Thus we recommend the adoption of public cloth mask wearing, as an effective form of source control, in conjunction with existing hygiene, distancing, and contact tracing strategies. We recommend that public officials and governments strongly encourage the use of widespread face masks in public, including the use of appropriate regulation.},

  abstract = {Childhood immunization is one of the most effective health interventions, making it a key indicator of progress towards universal health coverage. In the last decade, improvements in coverage have been made globally, however, slow progress has been documented in sub-Saharan Africa with considerable subnational variations. We explore potential drivers of equitable immunization services based on subnational DTP3 coverage estimates. Using vaccine coverage at the 5 by 5~km area from 2000 to 2016, we quantify inequality using three measures. We assess the shortfall inequality which is the average deviation across subnational units from that with the highest coverage for each country. Secondly we estimate the threshold index, the proportion of children below a globally set subnational coverage target, and lastly, a Gini coefficient representing the within-country distribution of coverage. We use time series analyses to quantify associations with immunization expenditures controlling for country socio-economic and population characteristics. Development assistance, maternal education and governance were associated with reductions in inequality. Furthermore, high quality governance was associated with a stronger relationship between development assistance and reductions in inequality. Results from this analysis also indicate that countries with the lowest coverage suffer the highest inequalities. We highlight growing inequalities among countries which have met national coverage targets such as South Africa and Kenya. In 2016, values for the shortfall inequality ranged from 1\% to 43\%, the threshold index from 0\% to 100\% and Gini coefficient from 0.01 to 0.37. Burundi, Comoros, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia, Rwanda, and Sao Tome and Principe had the least shortfall inequality ({$<$}5\%) while Angola, Ethiopia and Nigeria had values greater than 40\%. A similar picture was noted for the other dimensions of inequality among these particular countries. Immunization program investments offer promise in addressing inequality, however, domestic mechanisms for resource implementation and accountability should be strengthened to maximize gains in coverage.},

  abstract = {Objective To review systematically the evidence of effectiveness of physical interventions to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses., Data sources Cochrane Library, Medline, OldMedline, Embase, and CINAHL, without restrictions on language or publication., Data selection Studies of any intervention to prevent the transmission of respiratory viruses (isolation, quarantine, social distancing, barriers, personal protection, and hygiene). A search of study designs included randomised trials, cohort, case-control, crossover, before and after, and time series studies. After scanning of the titles, abstracts and full text articles as a first filter, a standardised form was used to assess the eligibility of the remainder. Risk of bias of randomised studies was assessed for generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow-up. Non-randomised studies were assessed for the presence of potential confounders and classified as being at low, medium, or high risk of bias., Data synthesis 58 papers of 59 studies were included. The quality of the studies was poor for all four randomised controlled trials and most cluster randomised controlled trials; the observational studies were of mixed quality. Meta-analysis of six case-control studies suggested that physical measures are highly effective in preventing the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome: handwashing more than 10 times daily (odds ratio 0.45, 95\% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.57; number needed to treat=4, 95\% confidence interval 3.65 to 5.52), wearing masks (0.32, 0.25 to 0.40; NNT=6, 4.54 to 8.03), wearing N95 masks (0.09, 0.03 to 0.30; NNT=3, 2.37 to 4.06), wearing gloves (0.43, 0.29 to 0.65; NNT=5, 4.15 to 15.41), wearing gowns (0.23, 0.14 to 0.37; NNT=5, 3.37 to 7.12), and handwashing, masks, gloves, and gowns combined (0.09, 0.02 to 0.35; NNT=3, 2.66 to 4.97). The combination was also effective in interrupting the spread of influenza within households. The highest quality cluster randomised trials suggested that spread of respiratory viruses can be prevented by hygienic measures in younger children and within households. Evidence that the more uncomfortable and expensive N95 masks were superior to simple surgical masks was limited, but they caused skin irritation. The incremental effect of adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing to reduce respiratory disease remains uncertain. Global measures, such as screening at entry ports, were not properly evaluated. Evidence was limited for social distancing being effective, especially if related to risk of exposure\textemdash that is, the higher the risk the longer the distancing period., Conclusion Routine long term implementation of some of the measures to interrupt or reduce the spread of respiratory viruses might be difficult. However, many simple and low cost interventions reduce the transmission of epidemic respiratory viruses. More resources should be invested into studying which physical interventions are the most effective, flexible, and cost effective means of minimising the impact of acute respiratory tract infections.},

  abstract = {Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been crucial in curbing COVID-19 in the United States (US). Consequently, relaxing NPIs through a phased re-opening of the US amid still-high levels of COVID-19 susceptibility could lead to new epidemic waves. This calls for a COVID-19 early warning system. Here we evaluate multiple digital data streams as early warning indicators of increasing or decreasing state-level US COVID-19 activity between January and June 2020. We estimate the timing of sharp changes in each data stream using a simple Bayesian model that calculates in near real-time the probability of exponential growth or decay. Analysis of COVID-19-related activity on social network microblogs, Internet searches, point-of-care medical software, and a metapopulation mechanistic model, as well as fever anomalies captured by smart thermometer networks, shows exponential growth roughly 2-3 weeks prior to comparable growth in confirmed COVID-19 cases and 3-4 weeks prior to comparable growth in COVID-19 deaths across the US over the last 6 months. We further observe exponential decay in confirmed cases and deaths 5-6 weeks after implementation of NPIs, as measured by anonymized and aggregated human mobility data from mobile phones. Finally, we propose a combined indicator for exponential growth in multiple data streams that may aid in developing an early warning system for future COVID-19 outbreaks. These efforts represent an initial exploratory framework, and both continued study of the predictive power of digital indicators as well as further development of the statistical approach are needed.},

Unfortunately, the majority of available data, primarily confirmed cases of COVID-19, are widely known to be biased indicators of the spread of the disease. In this paper we present a retrospective Bayesian model that is much simpler than epidemiological models of disease progression but is still able to identify the effect of covariates on the historical infection rate. The model is validated by comparing our estimation of the count of infected to projections from expert surveys and extant disease forecasts. To apply the model, we show that as of April 10th, there are approximately 2 million infected people in the United States, and these people are increasingly concentrated in states with less wealth, better air quality, fewer smokers, fewer people under the age of 18, less public health funding and more cardiovascular deaths. On the other hand, the percentage of foreign born residents and the proportion of people who voted for President Trump in 2016 are not clear predictors of COVID-19 trends.},

  abstract = {Objective
We compared the impact of three household interventions\textemdash education, education with alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and education with hand sanitizer and face masks\textemdash on incidence and secondary transmission of upper respiratory infections (URIs) and influenza, knowledge of transmission of URIs, and vaccination rates.

Methods
A total of 509 primarily Hispanic households participated. Participants reported symptoms twice weekly, and nasal swabs were collected from those with an influenza-like illness (ILI). Households were followed for up to 19 months and home visits were made at least every two months.

Results
We recorded 5,034 URIs, of which 669 cases reported ILIs and 78 were laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza. Demographic factors significantly associated with infection rates included age, gender, birth location, education, and employment. The Hand Sanitizer group was significantly more likely to report that no household member had symptoms (p{$<$}0.01), but there were no significant differences in rates of infection by intervention group in multivariate analyses. Knowledge improved significantly more in the Hand Sanitizer group (p{$<$}0.0001). The proportion of households that reported {$\geq$}50\% of members receiving influenza vaccine increased during the study (p{$<$}0.001). Despite the fact that compliance with mask wearing was poor, mask wearing as well as increased crowding, lower education levels of caretakers, and index cases 0\textendash 5 years of age (compared with adults) were associated with significantly lower secondary transmission rates (all p{$<$}0.02).

Conclusions
In this population, there was no detectable additional benefit of hand sanitizer or face masks over targeted education on overall rates of URIs, but mask wearing was associated with reduced secondary transmission and should be encouraged during outbreak situations. During the study period, community concern about methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was occurring, perhaps contributing to the use of hand sanitizer in the Education control group, and diluting the intervention's measurable impact.},

  abstract = {Background. Many authorities have assumed that the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will inevitably infect large fractions of the population in most countries. In addition, public health authorities and governments have varied in their policies regarding the use of face masks by the public.
Methods. Mortality data from COVID-19 and policies regarding mask usage in various countries were compiled from publicly available sources.
Results. The per-capita mortality approaches an upper bound which varies substantially between regions, from close to 1 in 3,200 dead in Italy and Spain, to less than 1 in 1,000,000 dead in other regions (e.g. Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Slovakia). Numerous countries which have maintained their mortality asymptote orders of magnitude below that of the hardest-hit regions have widespread adoption of masks by the public. The mortality curve of the Czech Republic following a mandate for public mask usage on March 19, 2020 is consistent with a levelling off of mortality, with avoidance of the high upper bound of mortality seen in much of the West.
Conclusions. There is up to 3 orders of magnitude of variation between regions in the total fraction of the population killed by the coronavirus well after the disease becomes established. Therefore, widespread infection with the coronavirus in a country is not inevitable\textemdash some countries have substantially controlled the spread of the disease. Public mask usage is one of several plausible explanations for the mortality reduction in some regions. The benefit of broad public use of masks might be better established by the end of April 2020, when the mortality trajectories in Western regions recently mandating mask usage are known. In the meantime, broad adoption of public mask usage is a reasonable strategy for infection control which should be adopted on the precautionary principle.},

DESIGN: Cross-sectional telephone survey of 705 Hong Kong and 1,201 Singapore adults selected by random-digit dialing.
RESULTS: Hong Kong respondents had significantly higher anxiety than Singapore respondents (State Trait Anxiety Inventory [STAI] score, 2.06 vs 1.77; P {$<$} .001). The former group also reported more frequent headaches, difficulty breathing, dizziness, rhinorrhea, and sore throat. More than 90\% in both cities were willing to be quarantined if they had close contact with a SARS case, and 70\% or more would be compliant for social contacts. Most respondents (86.7\% in Hong Kong vs 71.4\% in Singapore; P {$<$} .001) knew that SARS could be transmitted via respiratory droplets, although fewer (75.8\% in Hong Kong vs 62.1\% in Singapore; P {$<$} .001) knew that fomites were also a possible transmission source. Twenty-three percent of Hong Kong and 11.9\% of Singapore respondents believed that they were "very likely" or "somewhat likely" to contract SARS during the current outbreak (P {$<$} .001). There were large differences between Hong Kong and Singapore in the adoption of personal precautionary measures. Respondents with higher levels of anxiety, better knowledge about SARS, and greater risk perceptions were more likely to take comprehensive precautionary measures against the infection, as were older, female, and more educated individuals.
CONCLUSION: Comparative psychobehavioral surveillance and analysis could yield important insights into generic versus population-specific issues that could be used to inform, design, and evaluate public health infection control policy measures.},

Unfortunately, a lack of systematic testing across the United States (US) due to equipment shortages and varying testing strategies has hindered the usefulness of the available positive COVID-19 case counts.  
We introduce three complementary approaches aimed at estimating the prevalence of COVID-19 in each state in the US as well as in New York City. Instead of relying on an estimate from a single data source or method that may be biased, we provide multiple estimates, each relying on different assumptions and data sources. 
Across our three approaches, there is a consistent conclusion that estimated state-level COVID-19 case counts usually vary from 10 to 100 times greater than the official positive test counts. Nationally, our lowest and highest estimates of COVID-19 cases in the US from March 1, 2020 to April 4, 2020 are 2.7 and 8.3 million (9 to 27 times greater). These estimates are to be compared to the cumulative confirmed cases of about 311,000 as of April 4th. Our approaches demonstrate the value of leveraging existing influenza-like-illness surveillance systems for measuring the burden of new diseases that share symptoms with influenza-like-illnesses. Our methods may prove useful in assessing the burden of COVID-19 in other countries with comparable influenza surveillance systems.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Introduction: An important unknown during the COVID-19 pandemic has been the infection-fatality rate (IFR). This differs from the case-fatality rate (CFR) as an estimate of the number of deaths as a proportion of the total number of cases, including those who are mild and asymptomatic. While the CFR is extremely valuable for experts, IFR is increasingly being called for by policy-makers and the lay public as an estimate of the overall mortality from COVID-19. Methods: Pubmed and Medrxiv were searched using a set of terms and Boolean operators on 25/04/2020. Articles were screened for inclusion by both authors. Meta-analysis was performed in Stata 15.1 using the metan command, based on IFR and confidence intervals extracted from each study. Google/Google Scholar was used to assess the grey literature relating to government reports. Results: After exclusions, there were 13 estimates of IFR included in the final meta-analysis, from a wide range of countries, published between February and April 2020. The meta-analysis demonstrated a point-estimate of IFR of 0.75\% (0.49-1.01\%) with significant heterogeneity (p\&lt;0.001). Conclusion: Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of published evidence on COVID-19 until the end of April, 2020, the IFR of the disease across populations is 0.75\% (0.49-1.01\%). However, due to very high heterogeneity in the meta-analysis, it is difficult to know if this represents the "true" point estimate. It is likely that different places will experience different IFRs. More research looking at age-stratified IFR is urgently needed to inform policy-making on this front.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We estimate that the number of COVID-19 deaths in Italy is 52,000 {$\pm$} 2000 as of April 18 2020, more than a factor of 2 higher than the official number. The Population Fatality Rate (PFR) has reached 0.22\% in the most affected region of Lombardia and 0.57\% in the most affected province of Bergamo, which constitutes a lower bound to the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR). We estimate PFR as a function of age, finding a steep age dependence: in Lombardia (Bergamo province) 0.6\% (1.7\%) of the total population in age group 70-79 died, 1.6\% (4.6\%) in age group 80-89, and 3.41\% (10.2\%) in the age group above 90. We combine this with the Test Positivity Rate to estimate the lower bound of 0.84\% on the IFR for Lombardia. We observe IFR to trace the Yearly Mortality Rate (YMR) above 60 years, which can be used to estimate the IFR for other regions in the world. We predict an IFR lower bound of 0.5\% for NYC and 26\% of total COVID-19 mortality arising from the population below 65 years, in agreement with the existing data and several times higher than Lombardia. Combining PFR with the Princess Diamond cruise ship IFR for ages above 70 we estimate the infection rates (IR) of regions in Italy, which peak in Lombardia at 23\% (12\%-41\%, 95\% c.l.), and for provinces in Bergamo at 67\% (33\%- 100\%, 95\% c.l.). This suggests that Bergamo may have reached herd immunity, and that the number of infected people greatly exceeds the number of positive tests, by a factor of 35 in Lombardia{${_\ast}$}.},

The impact of individual behaviors on an outbreak was investigated through mathematical approaches. The reproduction number decreased from 4.1 to 0.7 after notification. The basic reproduction number was estimated, and the use of masks alone was shown to be insufficient in containing an epidemic. Intuitive results obtained by means of stochastic individual-based simulations showed that rapid improvements in behavior and isolation would increase the probability of extinction.},

Finally, using data on demographics we show large expected heterogeneity in overall IFR across countries.

  abstract = {The number of screening tests carried out in France and the methodology used to target the patients tested do not allow for a direct computation of the actual number of cases and the infection fatality ratio (IFR). The main objective of this work is to estimate the actual number of people infected with COVID-19 and to deduce the IFR during the observation window in France. We develop a 'mechanistic-statistical' approach coupling a SIR epidemiological model describing the unobserved epidemiological dynamics, a probabilistic model describing the data acquisition process and a statistical inference method. The actual number of infected cases in France is probably higher than the observations: we find here a factor \texttimes 8 (95\%-CI: 5-12) which leads to an IFR in France of 0.5\% (95\%-CI: 0.3 - 0.8) based on hospital death counting data. Adjusting for the number of deaths in nursing homes, we obtain an IFR of 0.8\% (95\%-CI: 0.45 - 1.25). This IFR is consistent with previous findings in China (0.66\%) and in the UK (0.9\%) and lower than the value previously computed on the Diamond Princess cruise ship data (1.3\%).},

Person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 infection led to the isolation of patients that were subsequently administered a variety of treatments. Extensive measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented to control the current outbreak. Special attention and efforts to protect or reduce transmission should be applied in susceptible populations including children, health care providers, and elderly people.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The world faces an unprecedented SARS-CoV2 pandemic where many critical factors still remain unknown. The case fatality rates (CFR) reported in the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic substantially differ between countries. For SARS-CoV-2 infection with its broad clinical spectrum from asymptomatic to severe disease courses, the infection fatality rate (IFR) is the more reliable parameter to predict the consequences of the pandemic. Here we combined virus RT-PCR testing and assessment for SARS-CoV2 antibodies to determine the total number of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infections in a given population. Methods: A sero-epidemiological GCP- and GEP-compliant study was performed in a small German town which was exposed to a super-spreading event (carnival festivities) followed by strict social distancing measures causing a transient wave of infections. Questionnaire-based information and biomaterials were collected from a random, household-based study population within a seven-day period, six weeks after the outbreak. The number of present and past infections was determined by integrating results from anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG analyses in blood, PCR testing for viral RNA in pharyngeal swabs and reported previous positive PCR tests. Results: Of the 919 individuals with evaluable infection status (out of 1,007; 405 households) 15.5\% (95\% CI: [12.3\%; 19.0\%]) were infected. This is 5-fold higher than the number of officially reported cases for this community (3.1\%). Infection was associated with characteristic symptoms such as loss of smell and taste. 22.2\% of all infected individuals were asymptomatic. With the seven SARS-CoV-2-associated reported deaths the estimated IFR was 0.36\% [0.29\%; 0.45\%]. Age and sex were not found to be associated with the infection rate. Participation in carnival festivities increased both the infection rate (21.3\% vs. 9.5\%, p\&lt;0.001) and the number of symptoms in the infected (estimated relative mean increase 1.6, p=0.007). The risk of a person being infected was not found to be associated with the number of study participants in the household this person lived in. The secondary infection risk for study participants living in the same household increased from 15.5\% to 43.6\%, to 35.5\% and to 18.3\% for households with two, three or four people respectively (p\&lt;0.001). Conclusions: While the number of infections in this high prevalence community is not representative for other parts of the world, the IFR calculated on the basis of the infection rate in this community can be utilized to estimate the percentage of infected based on the number of reported fatalities in other places with similar population characteristics. Whether the specific circumstances of a super-spreading event not only have an impact on the infection rate and number of symptoms but also on the IFR requires further investigation. The unexpectedly low secondary infection risk among persons living in the same household has important implications for measures installed to contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {COVID-19 is characterized by an infectious pre-symptomatic period, when newly infected individuals can unwittingly infect others. We are interested in what benefits facemasks could offer as a non-pharmaceutical intervention, especially in the settings where high-technology interventions, such as contact tracing using mobile apps or rapid case detection via molecular tests, are not sustainable. Here, we report the results of two mathematical models and show that facemask use by the public could make a major contribution to reducing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our intention is to provide a simple modelling framework to examine the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemics when facemasks are worn by the public, with or without imposed `lock-down' periods. Our results are illustrated for a number of plausible values for parameter ranges describing epidemiological processes and mechanistic properties of facemasks, in the absence of current measurements for these values. We show that, when facemasks are used by the public all the time (not just from when symptoms first appear), the effective reproduction number, Re, can be decreased below 1, leading to the mitigation of epidemic spread. Under certain conditions, when lock-down periods are implemented in combination with 100\% facemask use, there is vastly less disease spread, secondary and tertiary waves are flattened and the epidemic is brought under control. The effect occurs even when it is assumed that facemasks are only 50\% effective at capturing exhaled virus inoculum with an equal or lower efficiency on inhalation. Facemask use by the public has been suggested to be ineffective because wearers may touch their faces more often, thus increasing the probability of contracting COVID-19. For completeness, our models show that facemask adoption provides population-level benefits, even in circumstances where wearers are placed at increased risk. At the time of writing, facemask use by the public has not been recommended in many countries, but a recommendation for wearing face-coverings has just been announced for Scotland. Even if facemask use began after the start of the first lock-down period, our results show that benefits could still accrue by reducing the risk of the occurrence of further COVID-19 waves. We examine the effects of different rates of facemask adoption without lock-down periods and show that, even at lower levels of adoption, benefits accrue to the facemask wearers. These analyses may explain why some countries, where adoption of facemask use by the public is around 100\%, have experienced significantly lower rates of COVID-19 spread and associated deaths. We conclude that facemask use by the public, when used in combination with physical distancing or periods of lock-down, may provide an acceptable way of managing the COVID-19 pandemic and re-opening economic activity. These results are relevant to the developed as well as the developing world, where large numbers of people are resource poor, but fabrication of home-made, effective facemasks is possible. A key message from our analyses to aid the widespread adoption of facemasks would be: `my mask protects you, your mask protects me'.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous controlled studies on the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) - namely the use of facemasks and intensified hand hygiene - in preventing household transmission of influenza have not produced definitive results. We aimed to investigate efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of NPI in households with influenza index patients.
METHODS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial during the pandemic season 2009/10 and the ensuing influenza season 2010/11. We included households with an influenza positive index case in the absence of further respiratory illness within the preceding 14 days. Study arms were wearing a facemask and practicing intensified hand hygiene (MH group), wearing facemasks only (M group) and none of the two (control group). Main outcome measure was laboratory confirmed influenza infection in a household contact. We used daily questionnaires to examine adherence and tolerability of the interventions.
RESULTS: We recruited 84 households (30 control, 26 M and 28 MH households) with 82, 69 and 67 household contacts, respectively. In 2009/10 all 41 index cases had a influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 infection, in 2010/11 24 had an A (H1N1) pdm09 and 20 had a B infection. The total secondary attack rate was 16\% (35/218). In intention-to-treat analysis there was no statistically significant effect of the M and MH interventions on secondary infections. When analysing only households where intervention was implemented within 36 h after symptom onset of the index case, secondary infection in the pooled M and MH groups was significantly lower compared to the control group (adjusted odds ratio 0.16, 95\% CI, 0.03-0.92). In a per-protocol analysis odds ratios were significantly reduced among participants of the M group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.30, 95\% CI, 0.10-0.94). With the exception of MH index cases in 2010/11 adherence was good for adults and children, contacts and index cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that household transmission of influenza can be reduced by the use of NPI, such as facemasks and intensified hand hygiene, when implemented early and used diligently. Concerns about acceptability and tolerability of the interventions should not be a reason against their recommendation.

Swift government response to contain the outbreak requires accurate and continuous census of the infected population, particularly with regards to viral carriers without severe symptoms. We take on this task by converting the symptom onset time distribution, which we calibrated, into the percentage of the latent, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic groups through a novel mathematical procedure. We then estimate the reduction of the basic reproduction number \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend 0 under specific disease control practices such as contact tracing, testing, social distancing, wearing masks and staying at home. When these measures are implemented in parallel, their effects on \dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend\dbend 0 multiply. For example, if 70\% of the general public wear masks and contact tracing is conducted at 60\% efficiency within a 4-day time frame, epidemic growth will be flattened in the hardest hit countries. Finally, we analyze the bell-shaped curves of epidemic evolution from various affected regions and point out the significance of a universal decay rate of -0.32/day in the final eradication of the disease.},

  abstract = {What can we learn about the transmission process as the COVID-19's pandemic unfolds when the only available information is daily counts of confirmed cases and tests? In this paper we propose to go old school and apply simple time series treatments to filter away seasonality and atypical values. Then, we use the trend and cycle components of the resulting time series to emulate the underlying infection process (the data-generating process) that gave rise to the noisy signal we observe in the data. We use these trends to compute the effective reproduction number Rt and the test positivity rate {$\rho$}t, and propose a joint analysis of trajectories over (Rt,{$\rho$}t) space to have a graphical assessment of the current status of the infection process. Before applying our method to country data, we test it using simulations. We find that although the level of epidemiological indicators is systematically biased when based only on surveillance data, our method allows us to reduce the root mean squared error and the probability of type II errors, particularly when testing strategies are poor. Moreover, the joint analysis of Rt and {$\rho$}t manages to reduce the probability of type I and type II classification errors to below 0.5\% in our simulations. Our country analysis, on the other hand, shows that daily counts of cases and tests exhibit strong seasonal and atypical components, two types of stochastic innovations that are orthogonal to the infection process and that, if left untreated, can produce spurious dynamics in the behaviour of Rt and {$\rho$}t.},

We compare estimates of the coverage of the third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-containing vaccine (DTP3), which is typically delivered through routine immunization (RI), with those of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) for which SIAs are also undertaken. We find that SIAs have boosted MCV coverage in some places, but not in others, particularly where RI had been deficient, as depicted by DTP coverage.

We collected individual-case data for patients who died from COVID-19 in Hubei, mainland China (reported by national and provincial health commissions to Feb 8, 2020), and for cases outside of mainland China (from government or ministry of health websites and media reports for 37 countries, as well as Hong Kong and Macau, until Feb 25, 2020). These individual-case data were used to estimate the time between onset of symptoms and outcome (death or discharge from hospital). We next obtained age-stratified estimates of the case fatality ratio by relating the aggregate distribution of cases to the observed cumulative deaths in China, assuming a constant attack rate by age and adjusting for demography and age-based and location-based under-ascertainment. We also estimated the case fatality ratio from individual line-list data on 1334 cases identified outside of mainland China. Using data on the prevalence of PCR-confirmed cases in international residents repatriated from China, we obtained age-stratified estimates of the infection fatality ratio. Furthermore, data on age-stratified severity in a subset of 3665 cases from China were used to estimate the proportion of infected individuals who are likely to require hospitalisation.
Findings
Using data on 24 deaths that occurred in mainland China and 165 recoveries outside of China, we estimated the mean duration from onset of symptoms to death to be 17{$\cdot$}8 days (95\% credible interval [CrI] 16{$\cdot$}9\textendash 19{$\cdot$}2) and to hospital discharge to be 24{$\cdot$}7 days (22{$\cdot$}9\textendash 28{$\cdot$}1). In all laboratory confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases from mainland China (n=70\hphantom{,}117), we estimated a crude case fatality ratio (adjusted for censoring) of 3{$\cdot$}67\% (95\% CrI 3{$\cdot$}56\textendash 3{$\cdot$}80). However, after further adjusting for demography and under-ascertainment, we obtained a best estimate of the case fatality ratio in China of 1{$\cdot$}38\% (1{$\cdot$}23\textendash 1{$\cdot$}53), with substantially higher ratios in older age groups (0{$\cdot$}32\% [0{$\cdot$}27\textendash 0{$\cdot$}38] in those aged {$<$}60 years vs 6{$\cdot$}4\% [5{$\cdot$}7\textendash 7{$\cdot$}2] in those aged {$\geq$}60 years), up to 13{$\cdot$}4\% (11{$\cdot$}2\textendash 15{$\cdot$}9) in those aged 80 years or older. Estimates of case fatality ratio from international cases stratified by age were consistent with those from China (parametric estimate 1{$\cdot$}4\% [0{$\cdot$}4\textendash 3{$\cdot$}5] in those aged {$<$}60 years [n=360] and 4{$\cdot$}5\% [1{$\cdot$}8\textendash 11{$\cdot$}1] in those aged {$\geq$}60 years [n=151]). Our estimated overall infection fatality ratio for China was 0{$\cdot$}66\% (0{$\cdot$}39\textendash 1{$\cdot$}33), with an increasing profile with age. Similarly, estimates of the proportion of infected individuals likely to be hospitalised increased with age up to a maximum of 18{$\cdot$}4\% (11{$\cdot$}0\textendash 37{$\cdot$}6) in those aged 80 years or older.
Interpretation
These early estimates give an indication of the fatality ratio across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease and show a strong age gradient in risk of death.

We conducted a case-control study in Beijing that compared exposures of 94 unlinked, probable SARS patients with those of 281 community-based controls matched for age group and sex. Case-patients were more likely than controls to have chronic medical conditions or to have visited fever clinics (clinics at which possible SARS patients were separated from other patients), eaten outside the home, or taken taxis frequently. The use of masks was strongly protective. Among 31 case-patients for whom convalescent-phase ({$>$}21 days) sera were available, 26\% had immunoglobulin G to SARS-associated coronavirus. Our finding that clinical SARS was associated with visits to fever clinics supports Beijing's strategy of closing clinics with poor infection-control measures. Our finding that mask use lowered the risk for disease supports the community's use of this strategy.},

The platform also offers interactive visualization tools to analyze the full historical case curves in each region. Initially launched as a voluntary project to bridge the data transparency gap in North America in January 2020, this project by far has become one of the major independent sources worldwide and has been consumed by many other tracking platforms. The accuracy and freshness of the dataset is a result of the painstaking efforts from our voluntary teamwork, crowd-sourcing channels, and automated data pipelines. As of May 18, 2020, the project website has been visited more than 200 million times and the CovidNet dataset has empowered over 522 institutions and organizations worldwide in policy-making and academic researches.

In many cases, vaccines are only partially successful in reducing the infection rate, and respiratory protective devices (RPDs) are used as a complementary countermeasure. In devising a protection strategy against influenza for a given population, estimates of the level of protection afforded by different RPDs is valuable. In this article, a risk assessment model previously developed in general form was used to estimate the effectiveness of different types of protective equipment in reducing the rate of infection in an influenza outbreak. It was found that a 50\% compliance in donning the device resulted in a significant (at least 50\% prevalence and 20\% cumulative incidence) reduction in risk for fitted and unfitted N95 respirators, high-filtration surgical masks, and both low-filtration and high-filtration pediatric masks. An 80\% compliance rate essentially eliminated the influenza outbreak. The results of the present study, as well as the application of the model to related influenza scenarios, are potentially useful to public health officials in decisions involving resource allocation or education strategies.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of personal protective measures of health care workers (HCWs) against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
METHODS: A case-control study from ten hospitals in Guangdong, with 180 non-infected and 77 infected staff members that accessed the isolation unit every day, and participated in direct first aid for severe SARS patients. All participants were surveyed about how they were using personal protective equipment (PPE), protective drugs and hygiene habits when caring for patients with SARS. Statistical analysis was done with either chi(2) or Fisher's exact test for univariate analysis, whereas we used forward stepwise selection (Waldesian) for logistic regression.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis showed that mask, gown, gloves, goggles, footwear, "hand-washing and disinfecting", gargle, "membrane protection", "taking shower and changing clothing after work", "avoid from eating and drinking in ward", oseltamivir phospha tall had protective effects (P {$<$} 0.05), but stepwise logistic regression showed significant differences for mask (OR = 0.78, 95\% CI: 0.60 - 0.99), goggles (OR = 0.20, 95\% CI: 0.10 - 0.41) and footwear (OR = 0.58, 95\% CI: 0.39 - 0.86). Analysis for linear trend in proportions showed that dose response relationship existed in mask, gown, gloves, goggles, footwear, gargle, "membrane protection" and "taking shower and changing dree after work" (P {$<$} 0.01). The attack rate of HCWs who were rescuing severe SARS patients without any PPE was 61.5\% (16/26). It seemed that the more the protective measures were used, the higher the protective effect was (P {$<$} 0.001), and could reach 100\% if mask, gown, gloves, goggles, footwear, "hand-washing and disinfecting" were all used at the same time.
CONCLUSIONS: Nosocomial infection of SARS can be prevented effectively by precautions against droplets and personal contact. HCWs must take strict protection according to the guidance of WHO or Chinese MOH and pay attention to personal hygiene.},

  abstract = {Various mitigation measures have been implemented to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, including widely adopted social distancing and mandated face covering. However, assessing the effectiveness of those intervention practices hinges on the understanding of virus transmission, which remains uncertain. Here we show that airborne transmission is highly virulent and represents the dominant route to spread the disease. By analyzing the trend and mitigation measures in Wuhan, China, Italy, and New York City, from January 23 to May 9, 2020, we illustrate that the impacts of mitigation measures are discernable from the trends of the pandemic. Our analysis reveals that the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the pandemic trends in the three epicenters. This protective measure alone significantly reduced the number of infections, that is, by over 78,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9. Other mitigation measures, such as social distancing implemented in the United States, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public. We conclude that wearing of face masks in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission, and this inexpensive practice, in conjunction with simultaneous social distancing, quarantine, and contact tracing, represents the most likely fighting opportunity to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Our work also highlights the fact that sound science is essential in decision-making for the current and future public health pandemics.},

  abstract = {In response to several influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infections that developed in passengers after they traveled on the same 2 flights from New York, New York, USA, to Hong Kong, China, to Fuzhou, China, we assessed transmission of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus on these flights. We defined a case of infection as onset of fever and respiratory symptoms and detection of virus by PCR in a passenger or crew member of either flight. Illness developed only in passengers who traveled on the New York to Hong Kong flight. We compared exposures of 9 case-passengers with those of 32 asymptomatic control-passengers. None of the 9 case-passengers, compared with 47\% (15/32) of control-passengers, wore a face mask for the entire flight (odds ratio 0, 95\% CI 0\textendash 0.71). The source case-passenger was not identified. Wearing a face mask was a protective factor against influenza infection. We recommend a more comprehensive intervention study to accurately estimate this effect.},
