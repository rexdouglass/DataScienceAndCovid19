# Introduction

The SARS-COV-2 global pandemic has exposed weaknesses throughout our institutions, and the sciences are no exception. In this brief review, we enumerate ways that data science can and has contributed to filling or at least highlighting some of these weaknesses. Given the deluge of official statistics and 300+ new COVID-19 working papers posted each day, it is a ripe time to consolidate guidance for both consumers and producers of COVID-19 knowledge.^[[@COVID19Primer]]

In terms of understanding where we are, how we got here, and what is likely to follow, here are some of the things we are curious to know. We want to know the rate of spread of COVID-19 in a population, $R$, prior to any non-pharmaceutical interventions, $R_{0}$, over time following interventions/nonintervention $R_{t}$, and importantly across different political and demographic communities, $R_{ct}$. We want to know at any given point in time how many cases of active infection exist in a community, $I_{ct}$, and how many of those infections resulted in death $D_{ct}$. We want to know the causal effect of interventions, $X_{ct}$, on say rate of spread, between the observed treated populations $R_{ct1}$ and the counterfactual populations had they not been treated $R_{ct0}$. To do so, we will need some plausible identification strategy that allows us to account for the fact that interventions are themselves chosen and implemented in response to changes in $R_{ct}$, and that many third factors likely drive both $R_{ct}$ and $X_{ct}$. These unknowns give rise to fundamental problems of measurement, inference, and interpretation.

# Measurement

There is no direct measure of $I_{ct}$. The closest we have are serological estimates of Cumulative Infections, $CI_{ct}$. These are surveys that measure the presence of antibodies in a given population which is an indication of what percent have had COVID-19 at some point in the past, and cannot tell us how recently. They are still rarely available and they have false positive rates that make them inappropriate for populations early in their spread [@peelingSerologyTestingCOVID192020]. Further, they require careful sampling designs comparable to opinion surveys, otherwise their findings may not be representatvie of the full underlying population.

More commonly available are Confirmed Cases, $CC_{ct}$. CVOID-19 tests are administered in a jurisdiction, and positive results are tabulated, reported, and aggregated by increasingly nested bureaucracies. These bureaucracies are concerned primarily with releasing legally required contemporary measurements and not maintaining consistent historical time series. This has resulted is the world's largest most desperate scavenger hunt to scrape, transcribe, and translate counts disseminated in oral briefings, public websites, PDFs, and even static images [@alamoCovid19OpenDataResources2020]. Teams from every country are working in often uncoordinated and duplicated efforts to mung government reporting into consistent panel data including newspapers [@albertsunNewYorkTimes2020], and nonprofits [@usafactsUSCoronavirusCases2020], large private companies [@chiqunzhangBingCOVID19Data2020; @ashleywolfYahooKnowledgeGraph2020], consortiums of volunteers [@yangCovidNetBringData2020, @jzohrabCOVIDAtlasLi2020, @covid19indiaorg2020tracker, and Wikipedians.

The resulting ecosystem of panel datasets vary in spatial and temporal coverage, have little metadata about sources or changing definitions, and do not generally handle revisions to past counts from reporting sources. Direct comparisons between sources reveal worrying disagreements and temporal artifacts like reporting delays, seasonalities, discontinuities, and sudden revisions in counts upwards, or downwards [@wangComparingIntegratingUS2020]. It is not obvious how to correctly account for these problems or adjudicate between conflicting sources without a clear ground truth. There also isn't generally an archive of snapshots of the source material meaning reconstructing the full chain of evidence may no longer be possible. 

Likewise, we do not have direct measures of $D_{ct}$ but only Confirmed Deaths, $CD_{ct}$. $CD_{ct}$ suffers from all of the same problems as $CC_{ct}$, but is thought to suffer from less under-reporting. Choosing $CD_{ct}$ as the lesser of two evils, many projects attempt to take estimates of the Infected Fatality Rate, $IFR=D/C$  [@meyerowitz-katzSystematicReviewMetaanalysis2020], to infer plausible ranges for $C$. Others have turned to estimating Excess Deaths, $ED_{ct}$, which is a number proportional to the number of total deaths reported in an area above what would be expected given the number of deaths reported in previous years [@weinbergerEstimationExcessDeaths2020]. $ED_{ct}$ is also not a direct estimate of $D_{ct}$ as it can include deaths that were not caused by COVID-19 directly, e.g. other health conditions that received inadequate care during this period, and similarly can undercount the number of COVID-19 caused deaths as lockdowns reduce mobility and economic activity that might typically lead to deaths, e.g. car accidents.

Confirmed case and death counts mechanically depend on testing, but records of tests administered, $T_{ct}$, are even worse. In the U.S., much of what we know about trends in testing patterns come from journalistic efforts like the Covid-Tracking Project [@zachliptonCovidTrackingProject2020]. They encountered all of the regular problems plus additional ones specific to ambiguity to what kind of test count is being reported (testing encounters, number of people tested ever, number of swabs tested, etc). The type of test performed, and its false positive and false negative rate, is almost never included as metadata. Nor are the rules about how tests are being rationed and distributed recorded systematically. Further, these raw counts aren't generally available below the state level. ^[See [@NewCOVID19Testing2020] for a rare cross-section.] 

The general failure to track COVID-19 spread directly has led to a proliferation of innovative attempts to use other signals as proxies for cases. These include web searches, searches of medical databases, social media posts, fevers reported by home thermometer, and traditional flu symptom survailence networks [@koganEarlyWarningApproach2020]. While promising, proxy measures require ground truthing and regular calibration using something like regularly timed serological surveys on smaller geographic sample of the population.

Finally, non-pharmaceutical interventions are tracked by several academic and nonprofit teams [@haleVariationGovernmentResponses2020; @chengCOVID19GovernmentResponse2020a]. These interventions are intended to limit human mobility which is more directly measured by cell phone data provided by Google, Apple, SafeGraph, etc. <!--need the cite -->

# Inferences

The workhorse theoretical model for infectious disease spread is the Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed (SEIR) compartmental model [@brauerMathematicalModelsPopulation2012]. The intuition behind the SEIR model is that there are mechanical relationships, such as previous infections or deaths removing candidates from infection, the timing between exposure to the next possible transmission, and the degree to which immunity may exist in the population, which induce nonlinearities in disease spread. Disease spreads slowly at first, accelerates, and then burns out if left to its own devices. SEIR should be considered the theoretical floor for analysis, and a entire menagerie of extensions account for demography, testing, mobility, social networks, etc. 

The necessity for directly including the test data generating process in models of the epidemiological data generating process can't be understated. Per-capita testing rates are so temporarily correlated with per-capita case rates they are more of a proxy of testing availability than actual cases [@kaashoekCOVID19PositiveCases2020a]. Spatially, per-capita testing rates also correlate with urbanity and co-morbids [@souchCommentaryRuralUrban2020]. How many tests are given and to who varies systematically in response to conditions on the ground with both periods of rationing and blitzes. Worse, because almost any intervention will effect both cases and testing, the treatment effect of even an exogenous intervention is not identified. Estimating an effect requires a combination of sharp constraints on some parameters and informative priors on the relationship between the number of tests and the number of cases [@kubinecRetrospectiveBayesianModel2020].

# Conclusion





Depending on how closely one follows COVID-19 research, it may come as more or less of a surprise that our understanding of this pandemic is nowhere near that of the ideal. On the one hand, COVID-19 statistics are ubiquitous, over 300 new COVID-19 pre-publication papers are posted a day [@COVID19Primer], many countries have brought the spread under control, and there is race to complete trials on a number of vaccine candidates. On the other hand, there are a seemingly endless parade of reports on failures of testing, flip-flopping guidance on masks, flip-flopping guidance on mass-events, government efforts to limit or misrepresent case counts, etc. Not every country, has their spread under control, and many are just now beginning to enter their curves. These problems are just the tip of the iceberg for our issues of understanding this pandemic. Many of the things we take for granted are problematic in sometimes subtle ways.



Perhaps most taken for granted is that we have a clear understanding of how we got to this point, in terms of the introduction, spread, and decline of COVID-19 infections and deaths. We don't. Largely because, the institutional process of how measurements are taken, aggregated, and shared are often a larger source of variation than the actual empirical phenomenon. We have an increasingly sophisticated surveillance system, but its resolution is still too course to tell much more beyond general macro trends. Further, it started from such a low point, that most of the very important information about how the disease spread at the outset may be lost to time entirely.

Take the most widely reported figure, confirmed cases. As of this writing, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reports 5.2 million cases in the United States [@cdcCoronavirusDisease20192020]. The CDC does not directly measure COVID-19 cases, it is an aggregator of reports from 60 local, state, territorial, and tribal public health authorities. These different jurisdictions do not always define cases the same way, nor are those definitions constant over time. ^[In April 14, 2020 the CDC started adding together both reports of confirmed and probable, even though some states don't report probable cases or aggregate the two.] The CDC has some ability to reach directly past states to hospitals and laboratories through the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) and the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP), but it is for a limited sample of participating locations. ^[The CARES Act in March of 2020 standardized some reporting requirements from states to the CDC, but then for unclear reasons reporting was abruptly transferred to Health and Human Services (HHS). The picture at the state level and below isn't better. States also are aggregaters from hospitals, healthcare providers, and laboratories.] Depending on their size, cities have their own additional reporting structure that rivals some states. 






# Problems of Inference

In practical terms, this means that one of the main inputs to our epidemiological models isn't fixed, it is the product of its own data generating process with both error and systematic determinants. Very few models take this into account, and at a minimum their confidence intervals should be considered a lower bound of uncertainty. That is especially true toward the early months of the pandemic when reporting was most quickly changing.


Surveys

One might want to try to use positivity rate instead of case counts, but as the case count rises, 

cases and deaths
IFR should be bimodal and varies over time.



Other efforts are focused on using novel signals 

COVID-19 as an instrument.

Model evaluation



Government responses "13,000 such policy announcements across more than 195 countries" [@chengCOVID19GovernmentResponse2020]

Medical work with bad statistics

Social science with sophisticated statistics but no epidemiological model

Star hunting rather than explaining

Little evaluation, short memories, constantly changing models and forcasts.


# Problems of Scientific Culture

Science is about being curious about the true state of the world. Intellectual curious is not just a motivation, but also an ethical guardrail against outside pressures. Too often, society rewards bad science with attention, prestige, and accolades. Bad science may be propped up in order to support preferred policies, justify profitable behavior, or simply as entertainment. COVID-19 is no exception, even though the stakes are literally life and death. To move beyond past failures, our work must be driven by intellectual curiousity. 

Contrarianism

Problems of contrarianism

Conformity
Similarly 

-Bad papers getting through
-Rough papers getting withdrawn
-General intolerance for uncertainty

The insistence we have an answer undermined the political and social capital we need to fund and find ethical designs for challenge studies that can actually answer the question. The shift in public campaign strategy generates distrust of experts and conspiracy theories making it more difficult to deliver expert guidance on other issues. There are always some predictable and unpredictable second order effects from misleading people. Over representing the evidence behind masks can mislead people into thinking that masks are more important than or trade off with more effective strategies like social distancing.

The dirty secret of COVID-19 modeling is that there just isn't that much unique information there. You can torture a panel dataset with a small number of units and a high auto-correlation between time units into telling you whatever you want, but that doesn't make it true.




# Conclusion

Don't be discouraged but do the reading.



Comparisons across these different collection highlight major discrepancies between the series, 
Most case counts are geographic, even though there is growing evidence of differential rates across age and race.



As political scientists, we are constantly running into data challenges as we try to understand concepts and behaviors that are hard to measure. In contrast, working with COVID-19 should be relatively straight forward. Governments are routinely reporting the number of cases and deaths which we can simply merge into our datasets and include in a regression. To do so would be to propagate a lie. Before we continue with any COVID research, we must show data humility and understand what we are actually working with.



Desperately looking for other kinds of measurements but no real ground truth
The sensors we use to estimate infections have their own complicated data generating processes which we also don't know and can't measure well.
