# Introduction

The SARS-COV-2 global pandemic has exposed weaknesses throughout our institutions and organizations, and the social sciences is no exception. Even today, a half a year into the deadliest crisis most of us will ever see, we are still unable to answer basic questions about how human society should respond to the pandemic. [Example?]

As we consider the shape of things to come, we must also consider political science in the post COVID-19 age. To this conversation, we offer four lessons for social science from our own failures in understanding the pandemic.

<!-- Foremost, it showed that government institutions lack the capacity to  public health needs of their constituents.  -->

<!-- address all of the scientific, safety, and -->

<!-- Commercial, academic, and civil society efforts have stepped forward to fill this gap but often haltingly,  -->


# We must care about the truth

<!-- Let's face it, most of our audiences aren't interested in the truth. We must write to the few that do. And if that's not enough of an incentive to care about the truth, then as a field we must develop mechanisms to hold ourselves accountable.  -->


# Developing expertise is better than being an expert

<!-- You don't need to be an epidemiologist to make epidemiological claims, but you do need to use epidemiological models. Social scientists can (and should) drive in this lane, but there are some rules to the road -->


# Develop standing capabilities and collaborations



# Open source / publication process
<!-- Archive getting hammered -->

Data science transforms information from one form into another, e.g. county PDFs into time series databases.

Data science studies the institutional data generating processes, reporting varies, that variation can and often is bigger than the signal empiricists want to test in their models.

Data science concerned with performance, and evaluation, e.g. forcasting and measuring performance.

### Measurement- Cases

Surveys

Lit review of sources [@alamoCovid19OpenDataResources2020]

1Point3Acres [@yangCovidNetBringData2020]

New York Times [@albertsunNewYorkTimes2020]

Bing [@chiqunzhangBingCOVID19Data2020]

Yahoo [@ashleywolfYahooKnowledgeGraph2020]

USAfacts [@usafactsUSCoronavirusCases2020]

COVID Atlas li [@jzohrabCOVIDAtlasLi2020]

The Covid-Tracking Project [@zachliptonCovidTrackingProject2020]

### Institutional Data Generating Process

Sources don't agree with each other [@wangComparingIntegratingUS2020]

Counts a basically proxing for testing availability not prevalence [@kaashoekCOVID19PositiveCases2020a]

Handling testing induced effects correctly [@kubinecRetrospectiveBayesianModel2020]

### Measurement other things

Early warning [@koganEarlyWarningApproach2020]

Government responses "13,000 such policy announcements across more than 195 countries" [@chengCOVID19GovernmentResponse2020]

### Modeling

The dirty secret of COVID-19 modeling is that there just isn't that much unique information there. You can torture a panel dataset with a small number of units and a high auto-correlation between time units into telling you whatever you want, but that doesn't make it true.
