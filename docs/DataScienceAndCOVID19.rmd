# Introduction

The SARS-COV-2 global pandemic has exposed weaknesses throughout our institutions and organizations, and the social sciences is no exception. Even today, a half a year into the deadliest crisis most of us will ever see, we still continue to fail to answer essential questions about the causes and consequences of the pandemic. We have assessed the record of COVID research and review some of the most prominent articles and debates. In this article, we detail the three virtues for all research to follow, COVID-related or not, so that we may avoide the same failures going forward. These virtues are data humility, intellectual curiousity, and disciplinary decency. 

[Can add 1-2 paragrafs summarizing body if need filler]

There is a growing effort to forecast how the world will differ after the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, such en effort presupposes a clarity of measurement and understanding about the COVID-19 pandemic that largely does not exist now and might never materialize. This brief note outlines ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic caught our political and scientific institutions off guard and how the literally global effort to catch up will be able to close the distance. Where possible we highlight some places for optimism, some places for improvement, and some places to level expectations.

To begin, we first describe our understanding of the pandemic in a hypothetical ideal world. In an ideal world, we would know to an approximation how the disease spreads in a population without any interventions, the rate of spread at time zero $R_0$, and we would know how that changes over time before, during, and after interventions, $R_t$. The testing regime that serves to measure this would be extensive, well understood, and uniform over time and space so that changes in known cases would be attributed to changes in the rate of spread and not the testing regime. Likewise, who dies from the disease would be well and consistently measured over time and space so that we both know the inherent danger of the disease, the Infected Fatality Rate (IFR), and we can see that rate go up or down in response to interventions and resource constraints. With the above in hand, we would be able to make careful, reasoned, an equitable decisions about how to make takeoffs in choices that have long term health benefits but short term economic costs or short term economic benefits but long term health costs. We could plan for when, not if, the next pandemic arrives, and successfully anticipate the long term changes to domestic and international affairs.

None of the above exists. Depending on how closely one follows COVID-19 research, this may come as more or less of a surprise. On the one hand, there are a seemingly endless parade of reports on failures of testing, flip-flopping guidance on masks, flip-flopping guidance on mass-events, government efforts to limit or misrepresent case counts, etc. Unfortunately, these problems are just the tip of the iceberg for our issues of understanding this pandemic. Many of the things we take for granted are also problematic in sometimes subtle ways.

The institutional data generating process of COVID-19 data is as important if not more important than the empirical data generating process we care about. How measurements are taken, aggregated, and shared are often a larger source of variation than the actual empirical phenomenon. This pandemic is no exception. Take the most widely reported figure, COVID-19 confirmed cases. As of this writing, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reports 5.2 million cases in the United States [@cdcCoronavirusDisease20192020]. The CDC does not directly measure COVID-19 cases, it is an aggregator of reports from 60 local, state, territorial, and tribal public health authorities. As you might imagine, these different jurisdictions do not always define cases the same way, nor are those definitions constant over time. ^[In April 14, 2020 the CDC started adding together both reports of confirmed and probable, even though some states don't report probable cases or aggregate the two.] The CDC has some ability to reach directly past states to hospitals and labratories through the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) and the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP), but it is for a limited sample of participating locations. At the state level, the problem repeats with health departments aggregating information from hospitals, healthcare providers, and laboratories.

# Data Humility

As political scientists, we are constantly running into data challenges as we try to understand concepts and behaviors that are hard to measure. In contrast, working with COVID-19 should be relatively straight forward. Governments are routinely reporting the number of cases and deaths which we can simply merge into our datasets and include in a regression. To do so would be to propagate a lie. Before we continue with any COVID research, we must show data humility and understand what we are actually working with.

## 2)  Measurements are constantly being aggregated and reaggreated by different actors, and aren't being archived systematically.

There is no one in charge, there are no adults in the room.

## 5) The sensors we use to estimate infections have their own complicated data generating processes which we also don't know and can't measure well.

Counts a basically proxing for testing availability not prevalence [@kaashoekCOVID19PositiveCases2020a]

Handling testing induced effects correctly [@kubinecRetrospectiveBayesianModel2020]

## 1) We do not know how many people have had COVID-19 and we will likely never know.



# Intellectual Curiousity

Science is about being curious about the true state of the world. Intellectual curious is not just a motivation, but also an ethical guardrail against outside pressures. Too often, society rewards bad science with attention, prestige, and accolades. Bad science may be propped up in order to support preferred policies, justify profitable behavior, or simply as entertainment. COVID-19 is no exception, even though the stakes are literally life and death. To move beyond past failures, our work must be driven by intellectual curiousity. 


, and through application of evidence and methods, forming new more true beliefs than we held the day before.


## 6) Contrarianism complicates science

## 10) Star hunting rather than explaining

## 11) Little evaluation, short memories, constantly changing models and forcasts.



# Disciplinary Decency

[INTRO PARAGRAPH]

## 7) Conformity complicates science
-Bad papers getting through
-Rough papers getting withdrawn
-General intolerance for uncertainty

## 8) Medical work with bad statistics

## 9) Social science with sophisticated statistics but no epidemiological model

Dirty secrets - private institutions produce the data, government institutions aggregate it, private institutions aggregate it again.

We're almost always looking under the streetlamp.

We don't have mechanisms for sorting good evidence from bad.

Data science transforms information from one form into another, e.g. county PDFs into time series databases.

Data science studies the institutional data generating processes, reporting varies, that variation can and often is bigger than the signal empiricists want to test in their models.

Data science concerned with performance, and evaluation, e.g. forcasting and measuring performance.


The dirty secret of COVID-19 modeling is that there just isn't that much unique information there. You can torture a panel dataset with a small number of units and a high auto-correlation between time units into telling you whatever you want, but that doesn't make it true.
